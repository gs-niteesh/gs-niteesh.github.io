## Clock driver testing and Community review (July 22 Week 8)

This week I didn't achive much and was only able to test the clock driver with
the help of my mentor since I don't have a board where I could easily test the
driver. And as per feedback from my mentor during first evaluation I posted
all the patches to the mailing list to make sure everyone was aware of my work
and also to get their feedbacks on the patches.
